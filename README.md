# Preface
This is a repository for code A low-illumination Image Enhancement Algorithm Based on Morphological-Retinex
(MR) Operator as a python project.

In this project, I basically use the Morphological operator and retinex module as the main way to enhance low-light images.
I did this research at the end of my college lab time. I am not interested in it anymore. Thus, after the paper published, I send the code and hope it might be helpful to others.

# Tips:
The model is quite small, so it will take just seconds to finish the procedure, there is no need for high-level hardware.

The enhancement performance is highly dependent on training parameters. Once you change the parameters, you might get some eccentric results.

Please run pip install -r requirements.txt in your command at first.
